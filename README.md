ERRORS - index.html
There are two errors on the Index HTML file that appear in the W3 Validator when ran.  I could not find a solution to these two errors.  (They are listed below).

1. Error: Stray start tag div.

From line 65, column 7; to line 65, column 29

-->↩      <div class="container">↩     

2. Error: The aria-controls attribute must point to an element in the same document.

ERRORS - portfolio.html
There are two errors on the Portfolio HTML file that appear in the W3 Validator when ran.  The first error can be ignored and I could not find a solution to the second error.  (They are listed below).

1. Warning: This document appears to be Lorem ipsum text but the html start tag has lang="en". Consider using lang="zxx" (or variant) instead.

From line 1, column 16; to line 2, column 16

2. Error: The aria-controls attribute must point to an element in the same document.
